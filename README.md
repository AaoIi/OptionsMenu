## Description

OptionsMenu is a library written in Swift based on the options menu in material design in Android that allows you to easily add a menu to the navigation bar by adding a bar button item to the right side of the navigation bar, which then lets you open and close the menu. OptionsMenu is a popover style menu, which is set up as easy as a UIAlertController with every added action corresponding to a button in the menu. Actions are easily handled with a completion handler.
